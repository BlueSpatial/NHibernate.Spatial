NHibernate.Spatial
==================

This is not the official NH Spatial repo, this is only a copy of the final commit at [Nhibernate Contrib][NHContrib] site, 
the code has been modified slightly to get it to compile with the latest NTS, GeoAPI and Nhibernate binaries.


The NHibernate community website - <http://www.nhforge.org> - has a range of resources to help you get started,
including [wikis][NHWiki], [blogs][NHWiki] and [reference documentation][NH].
